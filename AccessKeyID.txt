Comment: Hi,

Please review the information listed below.

These details are based on the sample listed below.

wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
KeyID: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Access KeyID: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

First sample was not detected as there was no proximity keyword to capture. In second and third samples KeyID does not have a space (it should be Key ID) hence they did not match.

We were able to successfully generate incidents in out test environment after modifying the samples you shared with us.

AWS Secret Key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Access Key ID: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

The Regex used for this matching should be (?<![A-Za-z0-9/+=])[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}(?![A-Za-z0-9/+=]) if one needs to check in regex tester.

Above matching is for DP AWS Secret Access Key. There is another AWS Datapattern for matching AWS Access Key AWS Access Key ID . This data pattern will only match the access keys which start with AKIA and is a 20 letter alpha numeric key in all capitals. for example AKIA1256TYRT56545678
